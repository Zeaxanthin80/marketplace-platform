# Multi-Vendor E-Commerce Platform Roadmap

## Overview
A detailed roadmap for building a scalable, open-source, microservices-based e-commerce platform (Amazon.com-like) with portals for sellers, buyers, and admins. The platform will support inventory management, order tracking, and will be designed for worldwide web deployment and a future Android app.

**Environments:**
- Local Development: Yes
- Version Control: GitHub (requirements, diagrams, docs)
- Deployed: No

---

## Phase 2: System Architecture
**Estimated Time Frame:** 2 weeks

- Deployed: Staging/production cloud host (DigitalOcean, Hetzner, etc.)

---

## Phase 7: Security & Compliance
**Estimated Time Frame:** 2 weeks (ongoing)

- [ ] Secure all APIs (rate limiting, input validation)
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive data (at rest & in transit)
- [ ] GDPR and privacy compliance
- [ ] Regular security audits

**Environments:**
