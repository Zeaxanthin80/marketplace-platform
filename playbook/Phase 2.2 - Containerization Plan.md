# Phase 2.2 – Containerization Plan (Docker)

## Overview
This document outlines the containerization strategy for all microservices in the multi-vendor e-commerce platform, ensuring portability, consistency, and scalability.

## Goals
- Use Docker to containerize each microservice (frontend, backend, supporting services)
- Standardize Dockerfile structure and best practices
- Plan for local development, testing, and production builds
- Prepare for orchestration with Kubernetes

## Checklist
- [ ] Create a Dockerfile for each microservice and supporting service
- [ ] Use multi-stage builds for efficient images
- [ ] Store environment variables and secrets securely (not in images)
- [ ] Use Docker Compose for local development (optional)
- [ ] Ensure images are compatible with DigitalOcean Kubernetes

## Standard Dockerfile Example (Node.js/TypeScript)
```Dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --frozen-lockfile
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Run
FROM node:20-alpine AS runner
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY package*.json ./
CMD ["node", "dist/main.js"]
```

## Local Development
- Use Docker Compose to spin up all services, databases, and supporting infrastructure locally.
- Map ports for each service and expose only what’s needed.

## Production Considerations
- Use minimal base images (e.g., Alpine) for security and size
- Scan images for vulnerabilities (Trivy, Snyk, etc.)
- Tag images with version and commit SHA
- Push images to a container registry (GitHub Container Registry, Docker Hub, etc.)

## Next Steps
- Define Kubernetes manifests for deployment (see Phase 2.3)
- Automate builds and pushes with CI/CD

> Review and revise this plan as your services and requirements evolve.
