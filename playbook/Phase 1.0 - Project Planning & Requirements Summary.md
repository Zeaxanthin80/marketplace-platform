# Phase 1: Project Planning & Requirements (Summary)

This phase covers the planning, requirements gathering, and foundational decisions for the multi-vendor e-commerce platform.

## Goals
- Define MVP features for buyers, sellers, admins
- Gather compliance and legal requirements (privacy, payments, accessibility, sanctions)
- Research open source licenses and deployment hosts
- Define API contracts and microservices boundaries
- Decide on a scalable, open source tech stack

## Steps
- [x] 1.1: MVP Features — Core features for buyers, sellers, admins ([Phase 1.1 - MVP Features.md])

- [x] 1.5: Tech Stack Decision — TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, PostgreSQL, Docker, Kubernetes, etc. ([Phase 1.5 - Tech Stack Decision.md])

Each step has its own detailed markdown file in the playbook folder (Phase 1.X - ...).

## Outcomes
- Established a clear, documented foundation for all future development
- Ensured compliance and scalability from the start
- Made all decisions and documentation version-controlled for collaboration
