# Phase 2.5 â€“ CI/CD & Infrastructure as Code

## Overview
This document describes the plan for implementing Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment (CD), and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for the multi-vendor e-commerce platform.

## Goals
- Automate builds, tests, and deployments for all microservices
- Use Infrastructure as Code for reproducible, version-controlled environments
- Integrate security, linting, and vulnerability scanning into the pipeline
- Enable fast feedback and reliable releases

## Checklist
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions (or GitLab CI) workflows for each service
- [ ] Automate Docker image builds and pushes to a container registry
- [ ] Run automated tests (unit, integration, e2e) on every push/PR
- [ ] Lint code and scan for vulnerabilities (e.g., Trivy, Snyk)
- [ ] Deploy to Kubernetes using IaC (Helm, Kustomize, or raw manifests)
- [ ] Store Kubernetes manifests/Helm charts in version control
- [ ] Use Terraform or Pulumi to provision cloud infrastructure (optional)
- [ ] Set up secrets management for CI/CD (GitHub Secrets, Sealed Secrets)
- [ ] Document release and rollback procedures

## Example: GitHub Actions Workflow (Docker + Kubernetes)
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Build Docker image
        run: docker build -t yourrepo/yourservice:${{ github.sha }} .
      - name: Push Docker image
        run: docker push yourrepo/yourservice:${{ github.sha }}
        env:
          DOCKER_USER: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USER }}
          DOCKER_PASS: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASS }}
      - name: Deploy to Kubernetes
        run: |
          kubectl set image deployment/yourservice yourservice=yourrepo/yourservice:${{ github.sha }}
        env:
          KUBECONFIG: ${{ secrets.KUBECONFIG }}
```

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Use Helm or Kustomize to manage and template Kubernetes manifests
- Store all infrastructure code in Git for versioning and collaboration
- Optionally, use Terraform or Pulumi to provision cloud resources (Kubernetes clusters, databases, storage)

## Best Practices
- Require code review for all PRs to main branch
- Use separate environments (dev, staging, prod) with isolated pipelines
- Store secrets securely (never in code or Docker images)
- Monitor build and deploy status, and alert on failures

## Next Steps
- Implement and test CI/CD workflows for each service
- Document the deployment and rollback process for the team
