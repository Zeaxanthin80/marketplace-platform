# Phase 2: System Architecture (Summary)

This phase covers the design and planning of the overall system architecture for the multi-vendor e-commerce platform.

## Goals
- Design a scalable, maintainable microservices architecture
- Plan containerization and orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Define service discovery, API gateway, and communication patterns
- Prepare for CI/CD and infrastructure as code

## Steps
- [ ] 2.1: Microservices Architecture Diagram
- [ ] 2.2: Containerization Plan (Docker)
- [ ] 2.3: Orchestration Plan (Kubernetes)
- [ ] 2.4: Service Discovery & API Gateway
- [ ] 2.5: CI/CD & Infrastructure as Code

Each step will have its own detailed markdown file in the playbook folder (Phase 2.X - ...).

## Outcomes
- Designed a scalable, maintainable system architecture for the platform
- Established best practices for containerization, orchestration, and CI/CD
- Ensured all architectural decisions are version-controlled and ready for implementation

> Phase 2 completed: The project is ready to proceed with core service development and feature implementation in Phase 3.
