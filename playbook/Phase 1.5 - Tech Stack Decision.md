# Phase 1.5 - Tech Stack Decision

## Chosen Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework:** React.js with Next.js (SSR/SEO) or Vue.js with Nuxt.js
- **Language:** TypeScript  
  _Rationale: TypeScript provides static typing, better tooling, and easier maintenance for large codebases compared to JavaScript._
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (MIT, free and open source)  
  _Rationale: Utility-first, highly customizable, rapid prototyping, and strong community support._

### Backend
- **Framework:** Node.js with Express.js or NestJS (TypeScript)
- **API:** REST (OpenAPI/Swagger) and/or GraphQL (Apollo Server)
- **Authentication:** Passport.js (JWT/OAuth2)
- **Language:** TypeScript  
  _Rationale: Shared types with frontend, improved reliability, and maintainability._

### Microservices & Infrastructure
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (DigitalOcean Kubernetes Service)
- **API Gateway:** Kong or Traefik

### Database & Storage
- **Primary Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Cache/Session:** Redis
- **Search:** Elasticsearch or OpenSearch
- **Object Storage:** MinIO (open source S3-compatible)

### Monitoring & DevOps
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus & Grafana
- **Version Control & CI/CD:** GitHub + GitHub Actions

### Notifications & Email/SMS
- **Email/SMS:** Postal or Mailtrain (open source)
